Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation of One Solution CMS is rather simple but someday it will include a 5 minute installation tool.

Open the Configuration/defaultsettings.ini and fill in the DATABASE CONNECTION, SITE SETTINGS and TIER CONFIGURATION and save it inside of the Configuration folder with the new name of settings.ini.

Copy the entire contents of the One Solution CMS zip file that you downloaded and extracted to the folder that you wish to put your website in.

Go to the SQLTables/Install folder: their is a file called InstallTables.sql you will need to move the contents of the file into your database by ether the command line or a tool like phpMyAdmin tool. I recommend setting up phpMyAdmin, it is far easier and pretty straight forward. *In the near future you will not need to do this step because their will be coming an install tool that will automate this.

Once the InstallTables.sql file has been moved into your database you will need to open up the UpdateInstallation.sql file that is inside of the SQLTables/Install folder.

You will need to edit the on the first line, the second 'http://images.NEWSITE.com/' and change the NEWSITE to whatever your current site location is.

Next you will need to edit the second line, the second 'NEW SITE META KEY WORDS' and change NEW SITE META KEY WORDS to what you would like to have for meta key words for your site.

Next you will need to edit the third line, the second 'NEW SITE META DESCRIPTION' and change NEW SITE META DESCRIPTION to what you would like to have for a meta description for your site.

Next you will need to edit the fourth line, the "http://$SITEADDRESS/Administrators/" and change $SITEADDRESS to your sites web address.

Once these are done and the file has been saved as something other than UpdateInstallation.sql. You will need to move the contents of the file into your database by ether the command line or a tool like phpMyAdmin tool. I recommend setting up phpMyAdmin. In the near future their will be an installer build into the system but for now this method does work.

Once all these steps are done, the site can be setup with the url of your site/Administrators.  The log on information is User Name is Administrator and the Password is abc123. Make sure to change this password before pushing this site up live.
