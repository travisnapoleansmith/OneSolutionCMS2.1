Requirements
------------

The following requirements should be met prior to using One Solution CMS:
* PHP version 5.2 - Does not function properly in version 5.3 or 5.4. Will be corrected in the near future.
* PHP XMLReader and XMLWriter must be turned on.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation of One Solution CMS is rather simple but someday it will include a 5 minute installation tool.

Open the Configuration/defaultsettings.ini and fill in the DATABASE CONNECTION, SITE SETTINGS and TIER CONFIGURATION and save it inside of the Configuration folder with the new name of settings.ini.

Copy the entire contents of the One Solution CMS zip file that you downloaded and extracted to the folder that you wish to put your website in.

Go to the SQLTables/Install folder: their is a file called InstallTables.sql you will need to move the contents of the file into your database by ether the command line or a tool like phpMyAdmin tool. I recommend setting up phpMyAdmin, it is far easier and pretty straight forward. *In the near future you will not need to do this step because their will be coming an install tool that will automate this.
